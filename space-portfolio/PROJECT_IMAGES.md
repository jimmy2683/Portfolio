# Project Images for Your Space Portfolio

For the portfolio to display your projects correctly, you'll need to add the following image files to your public folder:

## Required Project Images

Place these files in the `/public` directory:

1. `/public/vr-visit.jpg` - Image showcasing your VR-VISIT project
2. `/public/skibbrizz.jpg` - Image showcasing your Skibbrizz social media app
3. `/public/ainexus.jpg` - Image showcasing your AINexus AI recommendation engine
4. `/public/smart-traffic.jpg` - Image showcasing your Smart Traffic app from Hacko Fiesta
5. `/public/job-portal.jpg` - Image showcasing your Job Portal System
6. `/public/ddr-simulator.jpg` - Image showcasing your DDR Simulator UI
7. `/public/profile.jpg` - Your profile picture

## Image Requirements

- Recommended size: 800x600px or 1200x800px (16:9 aspect ratio works well)
- Formats: JPG or PNG
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB per image)

## Placeholder Options

If you don't have actual screenshots yet, you can:

1. Use conceptual images that represent the project idea
2. Create mockups using design tools like Figma or Canva
3. Use technology-related stock photos (ensure you have proper rights/attribution)

## Adding Your Images

Simply place the image files in your project's public folder with the exact filenames listed above, and they will automatically be displayed in your portfolio.
